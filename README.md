# Feedback
If you have any feedback regarding the game, please contact us by joining the [Devs-Us Discord server](https://discord.gg/dccRRY8dcR "Discord Server") or by creating an issue on this GitHub repository. We are not bothered by any inquiries made in good-faith.

### **The Ideal Suggestion:**
- Makes the game harder.
- Shouldn't be too noticeable except if the player has to stumble on it. (for example: make players upside down!)
- If it's a task:
	- Take about 1-2 minutes to complete with and without knowledge of changes.
	- Shouldn't be too generic (for example: 40 asteroids for the task!).
- Not noticeable for anyone without mod (for example: crewmates can vent!).
- Shouldn't conflict with something already implemented.

If your suggestion conflicts with any of these, you are still invited to send your suggestion!
